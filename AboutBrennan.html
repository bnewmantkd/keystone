      <blockquote style="margin-left: 3%;">In the last 3 years I've spent at Oakland Tech, I have always been interested in computer science. 
        In tenth grade, I often went beyond the prompts I received from Mr. Wright, making my projects much more functional and interesting. 
        This practice continued in junior year, and that was how I got inspired by this project. 
        The idea of game-ifying science and making an application people can use daily seemed both constructive to society and a lucrative investment.
