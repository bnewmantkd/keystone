            Technology is often a sign of freedom from oppressors:<br>
            <blockquote class="bq1">"Americans believed the advocacy of manufacturing technology was a means of achieving liberation from English oppression."</blockquote><br>
            This shows itself in pride in domestic goods, nationalism, and patriotism.<br>
            <blockquote class="bq1">"Resistance to a dependency on imported goods manifested itself through renewed adherence to the republican values of frugality, personal industry, and, now, domestic manufacturing."</blockquote>

            After industrialisation, technology began to be relied upon more and more, until it was almost the immediate answer to any problem that society faced. It became deeply rooted in American culture and just as key to the country's values as the sovereignty of the people.<br>
            <blockquote class="bq1">"Technology was perceived as a remedy for social problems and as a positive agent for promoting social virtue."</blockquote><br>
            It became an aspect of everyday life, and as time passed, it became as if it was always there. People grew accustomed and comfortable with technology, one could even go so far to say they were complacent.<br>
            <blockquote class="bq1">"Ralph Waldo Emerson, enamored with his first train ride, noticed how railway workers were “impervious” to the presence of a train when it passed by"</blockquote><br>
            Now the American people are unable to function without technology, and worse, they are unable to lessen their reliance on even the most trivial uses of technology. Everyone has seen people on their phone not looking where they are going, or iPad kids glued to brightly-coloured screens:<br>
            <blockquote class="bq1">"In a staff meeting held in a sunlit room, my supervisor asked if we should turn on the lights."</blockquote>

            Unfortunately, with the Information Age, anyone from cyber-stalkers to huge corporations or entire government agencies have turned from inconvenient harassment to fully controlling one's life. Communication between peoples and the reach of malicious entities has multiplied a thousandfold, and everyone knows, "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely" Even the well-intentioned have taken it upon themselves to steal one's freedoms and liberties:<br>
            <blockquote class="bq1">"The interplay between power, liberty, and virtue mutated into a mentality that the virtuous ones, those who had the common good in mind and who also had the power of technology firmly in hand, were justified in exerting their influence over the liberty of the individuals."</blockquote><br>
            Much of the control that corporations and the like have gained over the people is subtle. One form it takes is consumerism. Advertisements and marketing provide ineffective solutions to the problems we have, or solutions for problems we never knew we had. Sponsorships are frivolous at best and scams at worst, so influencers can make you pay for stuff they were paid to have. Traits like patience and empathy are being roded away by social media and echo chambers, merely because the American people are ignorant of how they are being exploited.<br>
            <blockquote class="bq1">“Are our values influencing the development and application of technology, or are our values being influenced by the designers of technology systems for objectives other than the pursuit of happiness, liberty, and life?”</blockquote><br>
            It is wholly the fault of the companies extorting the people, it is also the fault of the people for falling into such a trap. Short attention-spans and dysfunctional education systems make it even harder for people to understand the dangers they're in. One <u>must</u> adapt to the world around them and destroy the ignorance caused by the mind's inability to keep up with the rate of technological development in the last two centuries.<br>
            <blockquote class="bq1">"The opportunity and ability to scrutinize technology is a right and a responsibility of all, and it must be the foundational skill of a technologically literate person."</blockquote>
